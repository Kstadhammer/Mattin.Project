## AI Assistance Acknowledgment

This project was developed with the assistance of AI tools, which helped with:
- Architecture design and implementation
- Database schema and relationships
- Input validation and error handling
- Console UI navigation and display
- Code quality and best practices

The AI assistance was primarily used for:
- Setting up the clean architecture structure
- Implementing the repository and service patterns
- Creating the interactive console menu system
- Configuring Entity Framework with SQLite
